Updates since v4.1

* Updating start date
* Removed scripted_id and put more info in scheduler_note
* Updated Survey and Detailer APIs, might result in small change in greedy surveys
* increasing template expiration time from 300 to 365 days (this might have hurt the color-slope metrics since it removed a bit of year 1 asymetry that was probably getting more color-slope pairs)
* swap "filter" to "band" (should have no effect on results)
