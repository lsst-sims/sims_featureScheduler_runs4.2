Make a tier of surveys dedicated to gathering templates early.

some things to set:
* don't observe the same area in the same night
* u and g only when moon is down
* need an area threshold so we get a big blob
* maybe an hour angle limit as well
* limit to 1st year
* exclude area that has been observed 3+ times
    * This might let in some random twilight observations, so possible further refinement



Parameters that could be varied:
* how large an hour angle range to allow (3.5, 2.5, 1.5)
* how long should we try to do a template gather blob? (default 33 min, but that's pretty random) (15, 33, 60, 90)
* how much area to demand before actually doing a template gather? (50, 100, 200, 400)
