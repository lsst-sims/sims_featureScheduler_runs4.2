Make a tier of surveys dedicated to gathering templates early.

some things to set:
* don't observe the same area in the same night
* u and g only when moon is down
* need an area threshold so we get a big blob
* maybe an hour angle limit as well
* limit to 1st year
* exclude area that has been observed 3+ times
